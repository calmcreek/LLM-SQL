## LLM-SQL

 This project successfully demonstrates the seamless integration of LLMs and relational databases
 to create a low-barrier interface for data access. The core contributions include:
 * LLM-based translation of human language to SQL
 * Real-time query execution on PostgreSQL
 * Intuitive and responsive frontend using Streamlit
 It shows that with structured prompt engineering and careful backend integration, LLMs
 like Gemini can power practical tools for democratizing data.
